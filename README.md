# Nextflow Pipelines

This repository will contain a collection of nextflow pipelines relating to
work that I carry out in my PhD. The aim is to implement as many analyses that
I do into standard pipelines so that I can easily re-use them, point to them
in publications and manage my data a little bit more easily.
