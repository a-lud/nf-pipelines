## Background

This repository is a collection of `Nextflow` workflows that I've written relating
to projects I've worked on. This repository acts as the implicit workflow, calling
sub-workflows which are stored in the git submodule `nf-workflows`. The sub-workflows
use 'processes' stored in the `nf-modules` git submodule.

The idea is to have workflows that generally follow best-practices with code that
is publication ready.

## Accessing old pipelines/versions

I've made some significant changes to how my pipelines operate recently. At the time of writing,
the `master` branch of this repository only has a few of the sub-workflows I've implemented.

To access the old version of this pipeline, download [this version (2f89cd6)][VERSION].

## Installation

Before doing anything, ensure you have a working installation of `Nextflow` on your system.
[Visit the installation page][INSTALL] for details on how to do that.

The pipeline also utilises `Conda` for software management. This can be installed following
the instructions provided [here][CONDA].

### Clone the pipeline repository

Clone this repository using the following command

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/a-lud/nf-pipelines.git
```

**NOTE**: It's important to install the software to a location that has a reasonable amount of storage space.
The pipeline will create a '`conda cache`' directory inside this repository which houses all the environments
used by this pipeline.

### Test the installation

To check that `Nextflow` and the pipeline 'works', try calling the help page

```bash
nextflow run /path/to/nf-pipelines/main.nf --help
```

The pipelines help page can be called using the '`--help`' command. Help pages for specific
sub-workflows can be called by passing the sub-workflow name to the help command.

```bash
nextflow run /path/to/nf-pipelines/main.nf --help assembly
```

If you encounter any errors, come back here and I'll try and help out.

## External software dependencies

I've attempted to use `conda` where I can for software dependencies. Unfortunately I've not been
able to package everything. Ensure the following softare are installed manually:

- `pin_hic` - A lightweight scaffolding tool that produces results similar to SALSA2 ([GitHub][PINHIC])
- `satool` - used to convert the *SAT* file produced by `pin_hic` to *AGP* format ([GitHub][SATOOL])

I also note here that many of the scripts in the `bin` directory are not my own and all
credit goes to the authors. I've simply aggregated the scripts I need in this repository.
I've tried to make it clear in the scripts where I've got them if the information is not
already present.

## Wiki

I've written a lot of documentation in the wiki, which can be accessed from tab at the top of the
page, or from [this link][WIKI].

I *highly* recommend at least reading the [Getting Started][GETSTART] entry to become
familiar with the pipeline (especially the storage requirements!).

## Citation

If you use any of the pipelines within this repository, please link to this
repo and that'll be more than enough.
