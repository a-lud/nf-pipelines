# Nextflow Pipelines

This repository will contain a collection of `Nextflow` pipelines relating to
work that I carry out in my PhD. My goal is to document as many analyses in
standardised workflows to:

1. Better document my code
2. Produce reproducible pipelines
3. Have a central code repository for publication purposes

## Planned pipelines

Pipelines I plan to write include:

- [x] [Multiple Sequence Alignment](https://github.com/a-lud/nf-pipelines/wiki/Multiple-Sequence-Alignment)
- [x] Selection analyses
  - [CodeML (ETE3 implementation)](https://github.com/a-lud/nf-pipelines/wiki/CodeML---ETE3-implementation)
  - [HyPhy](https://github.com/a-lud/nf-pipelines/wiki/HyPhy)
- [x] [Transcriptome Curation (`CD-HIT` and `TransDecoder`)](https://github.com/a-lud/nf-pipelines/wiki/Trascriptome-Curation)
- [ ] Sequence Alignment (`BWA2`, `Minimap2`)
- [ ] Variant Calling (`GATK`, `BCFtools`, `Freebayes`)
- [ ] Read Based Phasing (`Whatshap`)
- [ ] Demographic Analyses (`PSMC`, `MSMC`, `MSMC-IM`)
- [ ] Subtree Topology Weighting (`Twisst`)
- [ ] Admixture Tests

## Citation

If you use any of the pipelines within this repository, a citation would be greatly
appreciated. A simple link to this GitHub repository will be enough.
